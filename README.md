# About

This is a personal blog app.

Visit [my blog](http://www.rim99.com) to see what it's like.


# Structure

The front-end is based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), which is a popular and easy-to-use JavaScript framework.

The backend api app is powered by [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/). 

And the database is IBM's Cloudant, a commercial version of CouchDB. 

# TODO

The responsive layout is a problem, especially for smartphone, both in lanscape mode and protrait mode.
